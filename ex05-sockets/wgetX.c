     *   Use 'write' function to send the request into the socket.
     *
     *   Note: You do not need to send the end-of-string \0 character.
     *   Note2: It is good practice to test if the function returned an error or not.
     *   Note3: Call the shutdown function with SHUT_WR flag after sending the request
     *          to inform the server you have nothing left to send.
     *   Note4: Free the request buffer returned by http_get_request by calling the 'free' function.

    /*
     * To be completed:
     *   Now you will need to read the response from the server.
     *   The response must be stored in a buffer allocated with malloc, and its address must be save in reply->reply_buffer.
     *   The length of the reply (not the length of the buffer), must be saved in reply->reply_buffer_length.
     *
     *   Important: calling recv only once might only give you a fragment of the response.
     *              in order to support large file transfers, you have to keep calling 'recv' until it returns 0.
     *
     *   Option 1: Simplistic
     *     Only call recv once and give up on receiving large files.
     *     BUT: Your program must still be able to store the beginning of the file and
     *          display an error message stating the response was truncated, if it was.
     *
     *   Option 2: Challenge
     *     Do it the proper way by calling recv multiple times.
     *     Whenever the allocated reply->reply_buffer is not large enough, use realloc to increase its size:
     *        reply->reply_buffer = realloc(reply->reply_buffer, new_size);
